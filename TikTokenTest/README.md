Context Management and Token Counting Simulation

Introduction
This script demonstrates dynamic context management and token counting using TikToken with OpenAI models. It simulates user inputs and showcases how context can be efficiently managed over a series of iterations, with context trimming to maintain performance and resource utilization.

Requirements
- Python 3.6+
- colorama
- tiktoken (custom package for encoding and managing tokens with OpenAI models)

Usage
1. Install the required packages from requirements.txt.
2. Run the script in a Python environment: python TikTokenTest.py
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to start the simulation.
