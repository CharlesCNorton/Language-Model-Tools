# OpenAIText2ChatConverter

## Introduction
OpenAIText2ChatConverter is a Python tool that leverages OpenAI's language models to convert text into Chat Markup Language (ChatML). It's designed for asynchronous processing and is ideal for enhancing chatbot interactions and data analysis.

## Features
- Asynchronous Text to ChatML Conversion: Converts text files into ChatML efficiently.
- OpenAI Model Integration: Uses OpenAI's language models for high-quality conversion.
- Customizable Processing: Options for different models and modes like Q&A, Summary, and Transcription.
- User-Friendly GUI: Simplified interface for easy operation.
- Comprehensive Logging: Detailed logs for troubleshooting.

## Usage
1. Launch the GUI by running `OpenAIText2ChatConverter.py`.
2. Enter your OpenAI API key and organization details.
3. Select the input text file and set the output file path.
4. Choose the processing model and mode. Modify 'Summary' and 'Transcription' modes as needed.
5. Click 'Convert to ChatML' to start the conversion.

## Cost Caution
Before using this tool extensively, experiment with smaller datasets and the GPT-3 model to understand the potential costs associated with token usage. Be aware of your usage patterns and associated costs.

## Customizing Modes
Adjust 'Summary' and 'Transcription' modes for specific needs in this initial release. Check the script sections to tailor these modes.
